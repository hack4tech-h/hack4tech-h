# Frequently Asked Questions and Answers

## Dependency issues

**Q: What should I do if I encounter a failure to compile a dependent library during the installation process? **

A: You can try the following methods:

1. Go to the third-party platform that provides the compiled whl file, find the corresponding library and manually download and install it. The third-party platforms include:
 * [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs)
 * [https://pythonwheels.com/](https://pythonwheels.com/)

Select the corresponding version and execute the following command to install it manually. For example, when compiling brotlipy fails, find [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#brotlipy](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs /#brotlipy), because my system is Windows 10 64-bit, I use Python 3.8 to download `brotlipy-0.7.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl` (generally download the latest version), and then install it manually:

```bash
pip3 install brotlipy-0.7.0â€‘cp38â€‘cp38â€‘win_amd64.whl
```

2. Go to the project address issues and wiki of the library to find out if there is a solution, if not, send them an email with issues ðŸ˜œ.

## Usage issues

**Q: Why is the final result empty after running garuda? **

*A: There are several possibilities: the first possibility is that the target domain name has no subdomains. Second, because OneForAll will automatically verify subdomains by default, only valid subdomains will be available during export, so there are cases where there are no valid subdomains when exporting. You can use --valid=None to specify to export all discovered subdomains when running OneForAll. You can also use --verify=False to specify not to verify the validity of the subdomain. *

**Q: The following similar error occurred when installing dependencies, how to solve it? **
   Cannot uninstall'PyYAML'. It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall.

*A: Try to add the --ignore-installed parameter when installing dependencies*

**Q: There are garbled Chinese characters in the csv opened by Excel, how to solve it? **

*A: Since Excel opens the file with BOM header recognition code, and the resultant csv file generated by default is UTF-8 code instead of UTF-8-BOM, Chinese garbled characters will appear when Excel is opened. There are the following solutions:

1. Run OneForAll at the beginning and set the format parameter to xls or xlsx format.

2. Use NotePad++ similar tools to convert the encoding format to UTF-8-BOM.

3. Use Excel software to import the data in the result csv file.
